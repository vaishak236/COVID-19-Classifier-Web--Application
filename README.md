# Abstract
The use of AI(Artificial Intelligence) for Medical Diagnosis has been progressively changing in recent years. The use of AI to detect COVID-19 Infections or any Abnormalities using Chest X-Rays is far more efficient than the present tests such as Rapid Antigen Tests and RT-PCR Tests which have low sampling capacity. The Development of computer vision systems supports medical applications such as increasing image quality, organ segmentation, and organ texture classification have been very useful in designing and building models for training and testing the given dataset using Deep Learning Libraries which is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain.
